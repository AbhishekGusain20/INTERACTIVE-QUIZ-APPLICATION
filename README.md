##Welcome to my Quiz Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
This is a fully interactive web-based quiz app that lets users answer multiple-choice questions, get instant feedback, track their score, and experience dynamic question loading ‚Äî all in a clean, responsive interface.

üöÄ Project Description
This project is a responsive quiz application developed to showcase front-end web development skills using vanilla JavaScript. The app enables users to test their knowledge by answering a series of questions. As soon as a user selects an answer, the app immediately displays whether the choice is correct or incorrect, along with the right answer. It also maintains a live score and presents the final result at the end.

The quiz is designed to be simple, intuitive, and functional on both desktop and mobile devices.
